- unittest
Python's unittest in its simplest form consists of the function main and the class TestCase
Define a class that extends TestCase. Each function inside this class must start with "test"

Unittest workflow is:
1. you import main and TestCase from unittest
2. You define your own class derived from TestCase.
3. Then you fill it with functions that start with ‘test’.
3. You run the tests by placing main() in your file, usually at the bottom.

assertEqual() is one of many kinds of assertions that unittest provides

Python's self is analogous to Java's this

Python's unittest has the nice property that even an internal assertion failure will not stop it 
from running all of the tests

the quality of the unit tests is essential to the usefulness of doing unit tests
