•	Comments in Python:
 	#   : for one line 
	''' : for a multiline comment

• if __name__ == "__main__" :
     main()

main() is executed only if the file, which contain "main()", is run directly, and not imported.

Note: __name__ is an attribute that is automatically set and has the value "__main__" only 
if the file is executed as a script (not if it is imported as a module).

•	Script vs module:
	Script: directly executable piece of code (run by itself).
	Module: a library, imported by other piece of code.

•	cProfile: 
an optimization tool that is used to diagnose what makes a program slow.
The output of applying this tool to a python script includes information such as total running time,
 time of each separate function, and how many times each function is executed.

•	-m flag
 allow us to run a modules such as cProfile as a script.

•	range(): returns an object which produces elements on demand. 

•	Three ways to execute a Hello.py
	type in the shell: "python Hello.py"
	give executable permission to the file and type in the shell: "Hello.py"
	run the python interpreter and type in: "import Hello"

•	#! /usr/bin/env python3
	It's a commented line for Python 
	Informs the OS that this file should be run by python.

In a Unix-like operating system, the program loader takes the presence of these two characters 
as an indication that the file is a script, and tries to execute that script using the interpreter 
specified by the rest of the first line in the file.
