Start off right in classwork.

- Decied on a command-line interpreter, Git Bash that 
comes with Git for Windows or Terminal for Mac.
- Git a Unix basic commands cheat sheet.

- "make" program is a building tool which runs on Unix and Linux.

Edit System Environment Variable.
Say you have a executable called "file.exe", and it is located in "C:\Documents\". So the path to the executable is "C:\Documents\file.exe".

Now if you want to run this executable from command line, you can either:

Go to that directory (`cd C:\Documents`), and run `.\file.exe`. Here, ".\" tells the command line interpreter that you want to run 
the file in "current directory". Or, Specify the full path to the executable --- Run `C:\Documents\file.exe` from any directory. Or,
Add "C:\Documents" to "PATH" environment variable. This tells the command line interpreter where to find a file 
if the command does not specify a path. With "C:\Documents" in "PATH", you can simply run "file.exe" from anywhere.
