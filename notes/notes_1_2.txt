- Collatz Conjecture

take a positive int
if even, divide by 2
if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
repeat until 1

5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
cycle length of 5 is 6
cycle length of 10 is 7

- Assertions
assertions are good computational comments and they're invaluable to a future maintainer of the code

an assertion failure reports 
•	the filename, 
•	the function name, 
•	the line number, and 
•	the expression where the failure occurred

executing Python with -O turns off all assertions

assertions are not appropriate for testing code
unit test frameworks like Python's unittest are

assert is NOT good for testing
assert is NOT good for user error

they are appropriate for programmer errors
exceptions will be the correct tool for user errors

When an assert fails, it stops the program. When I am testing a program. 
I do not want the program to stop. I need to complete all tests. 
That's why we use unit testing.
