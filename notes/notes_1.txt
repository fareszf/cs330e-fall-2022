- Software Engineering:
concept first appeared in a NATO conference in Germany in 1968 to handle software crisis.

The causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware 
and the software development process. 
The crisis manifested itself in several ways:
•	Projects running over-budget
•	Projects running over-time
•	Software was very inefficient
•	Software was of low quality
•	Software often did not meet requirements
•	Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain

Software activities (or processes) vs Software development models
• Activities required to develop a software system. 
Activities include analysis, design, implementation, verification  and validation (testing), maintenance. 
• A software development model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description 
of a process from some particular perspective.

Basic development models are: waterfall, incremental, and reuse oriented software development.

Software Engineering: Software engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools 
for professional software development.
